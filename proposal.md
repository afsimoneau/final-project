# Final Project Proposal

## Team: Kyle Mikolajczyk, Alex Simoneau, Robear Mankaryous, & Alexa Freglette

## Proposal

Create an audio playground that would allow the user to create/combine/overlap audio “objects” in a virtual space, like how guitarists use pedals to alter sound. Based on frequencies, colors will generate on the background as “color fields” emanating from the “source” objects. These colors can mix in different ways to visualize the way the sounds are interacting. For example a sound with a high frequency may be associated with the color blue (#0000FF), while a sound with a lower frequency may be associated with the color red (#FF0000), therefore when played together these the fields would blend to make a purple (#800080) color on the intersection of their radii. To access the website users would have to sign in which will allow them to store their playground state and objects in a database to use again in the future.

A potential extra feature could be allowing users to upload their own sounds instead of generating from waveforms, or adding a way to program timing changes of parameters in the audio objects.

## Task assignment

**Alex**: I’ve got a background in electronic music work so I’m comfortable with doing some of the js frontend. Visualization isn’t my strong suit but I can also work on the backend with saving the playground state to a noSQL db (even though i like using SQL).

**Alexa**: I’ve previously worked a lot with CSS and styling sheets, which is my strong suit for this project. I have also been working with Web Audio API for my a4 project so I feel comfortable working on the sounds for this project.

**Robear**: I have worked with various front-end visualization frameworks for javascript, such as Three.js and P5.js, and will definitely be able to help with the visualization aspect of this project. I have also written fragment/vertex shaders from scratch for WebGL, if we decide against using any particular frameworks. I also have Svelte experience after Assignment 4, though perhaps not enough to fully commit to it over React.

**Kyle**: I have worked on many JS websites such as my own and node.js frameworks. For A4 i am making a 3D waveform based off of music, so I think my learning knowledge of Three.js will help with 3D visuals with the final project, as well as my background of playing a brass instrument and taking many Music classes at WPI with the focus on music with machines and MIDI.
